# SU ACT's 10th Regeneration Appeal Dinner ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c37e485-8cde-4ba5-bd13-b760ccf98fca.jpg)

## Have had heard about our 10th annual Regeneration Appeal Dinner coming up on Wednesday 9 March? 

It is going to be a great night with Clayton Fergie, a former SU ACT Director and Scripture Union International youth consultant speaking, and the ARIA winning Idea of North playing for us. There will also be a chance to hear stories from Scripture Union ACT's ministries and about our plans for the future.

There is no charge to attend but it is a fundraising dinner, so you will be asked to make a donation at the end of the evening to support our important ministry. 

The Dinner will be held at the Hellenic Club, 1 Matilda Street, Phillip, ACT at 6:30pm with the formal part of the evening finishing at 9:30pm. 

If you would like to attend you can register as an individual, join a table hosted by someone else or host a table yourself. You are welcome to invite other Christians you know, but please make sure they understand it is a fundraising dinner and they will be asked to donate.
Don't miss out, register today!

Registrations close on 27 February. 

The Regeneration Appeal dinner is always a highlight on the ACT Christian calendar, I'll look forward to seeing you there!
