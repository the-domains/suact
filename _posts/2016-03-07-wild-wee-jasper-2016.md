Wild Wee Jasper
is an adventure
camp for high
school students. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/37186416e4d4f06fd33142194a9bb4449dc2d954.png)

Join us as we
camp out, relax together and participate
in adventurous activities like
caving, scrambling, high ropes
courses, water activities and more!
We'll also be learning about the
Christian faith through talks and
small group time. These talks
and small groups are designed to
be accessible and interesting to
campers regardless of their beliefs. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d7be90c-14a9-4ae4-8af1-febe5e6664a1.png)
